# WarmPath: Product & Engineering Principles

## Product

- **Personal network coordination tool**—not a social network, CRM, or referral marketplace.
- **Private by default:** Personal networks are user-owned; nothing is shared unless the user explicitly shares.
- **Atomic action:** The core flow is (1) query your personal network, (2) selectively share results. No passive sharing or broadcasting.
- **Projects** are optional containers for coordination, not mechanisms for exposure.
- **Trust and clarity** over polish.

## Engineering

- **Correctness first:** Behavior and data flow must be correct; edge cases and privacy boundaries matter.
- **Simplicity:** Prefer clear, minimal solutions. Fewer concepts and moving parts.
- **Learnability:** Code and UX should be easy to understand for future contributors and users.
- **Avoid overengineering:** No speculative features, unnecessary abstractions, or “just in case” complexity. Build what’s needed.

When in doubt, choose the simpler, more correct option.
